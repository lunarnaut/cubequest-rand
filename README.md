CubeQuest Random Data Generation
================================

This simple Python 3 program generates random data blocks (as a list of 32-bit
words, at present) for the
[NASA CubeQuest Challenge](http://www.nasa.gov/cubequest/).

The seed generation and Linear Congrent Generator are based on Section 4.4
(Data Transmission Methodology) of the "Communications Procedure for Both
In-Space Challenges" (CommsProc), revision 1, document, available on the
[CubeQuest website](http://www.nasa.gov/cubequest/details/).
